        <h1> The denial of abortion and its effects </h1>
        <p>
          
        </p>
        
        <p>Our narritive structure is more of like an informational pamphlet in the structure of a story. We have dialouge and distinct 
            characters that try and explain our viewpoint. At first, we didn't know how to explain or make a story of this type of issue, 
            but we decided to go for something that tells a story of a woman who experienced abortion with an abusive husband, to shed light on an
            issue thats very common. It touches on taboo issues like homelesness or single parenting, abuse, and ect. The structure we wanted to go for  w
            simple to understand, but still very insightful. With only atleast 40 seconds to a minuete in total, we needed something that would spark interest 
            despite the simplicity.</p>
        
        <p> The characters our story currently holds are two differnet characters, a woman and a male. The woman we wanted her to look distraught and tired,
            since her story holds a very draining and sad event.
