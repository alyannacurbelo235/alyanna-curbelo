        <h1> The denial of abortion and its effects </h1>

        <p>Our narritive structure is more of like an informational pamphlet in the structure of a story. We have dialouge and distinct 
            characters that try and explain our viewpoint. At first, we didn't know how to explain or make a story of this type of issue, 
            but we decided to go for something that tells a story of a woman who experienced abortion with an abusive husband, to shed light on an
            issue thats very common. It touches on taboo issues like homelesness or single parenting, abuse, and ect. The structure we wanted to go for  w
            simple to understand, but still very insightful. With only atleast 40 seconds to a minuete in total, we needed something that would spark interest 
            despite the simplicity.</p>
        
        <p>Our story currently holds are two differnet characters, a woman and a male. The woman, we wanted her to look distraught and tired,
            since her story holds a very draining and sad event. We made her a victim of a forced intimate relationship, which resulted in a baby
            she could not get rid of. This would be because of the denial to abortion, which is what our story is based on. The male, we made him a more
            simpler character. He was simply the man who forced her into this situation, which we wanted to shed light on since its very common in abortion 
            situations. Besides our character designs, the designs for our other mechanical systems like the diaglouge or box itself both share simplicity.
            For our dialouge, we decided to stick with a paper on a stick. We decided to use more simplier language with readable dialouge, so it will
            come off as precise and clean. With our box, we took a few pieces of carboad and formed an L shape facing the front. This was so it had the same type 
            of imiation as a puppet show. Behind the face of the L box, is where our mechanical devices that help set up the code are put.</p>.
